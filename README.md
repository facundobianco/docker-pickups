# Docker container for pickups

[Pickups](https://github.com/mtomwing/pickups) is an IRC gateway for
Google Hangouts using [hangups](https://github.com/tdryer/hangups).

Useful for groupchats, which gtalk's XMPP doesn't support. 

## Bug

The last hangups release doesn't work with pickups, there is 
[a ticket](https://github.com/mtomwing/pickups/issues/9) about it.
