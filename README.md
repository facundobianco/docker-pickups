# Docker container for pickups

[Pickups](https://github.com/mtomwing/pickups) is an IRC gateway for
Google Hangouts using [hangups](https://github.com/tdryer/hangups).

Useful for groupchats, which gtalk's XMPP doesn't support. 

## Upgrade to hangups 0.3

This container uses a [pickups fork](https://github.com/Zopieux/pickups) 
that supports hangups latest version. There is
[an issue](https://github.com/mtomwing/pickups/issues/9) about it.
